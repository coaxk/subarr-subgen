"""Validate that the patched upstream/subgen.py meets subarr's structural
contract. Runs after apply-patches.sh.

Gates (in order):
  1. compile() — patched source must compile in-memory without SyntaxError
  2. AST: transcribe_existing has 'reverse' arg
  3. AST: batch() has 'reverse' arg
  4. AST: gen_subtitles_queue returns at least one string constant
  5. text: language_specific_kwargs present (from patch 0001)
  6. text: '@app.get("/queue")' present (from patch 0007)
  7. text: 'JSONResponse' imported (from patch 0006)
  8. text: '[v4.2 PATCH] _queued / _processing track' present (from patch 0007)
  9. text: 'Eager model load on boot' present (from patch 0002)

Exits non-zero with a clear message on first failure. This is the
"would subarr-subgen actually work?" gate; a clean run means the image
is safe to build.

Mirrors update_subgen_v4.py's STEP 7 (compile) and STEP 8 (AST) gates.
