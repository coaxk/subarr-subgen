# Open-or-update a single sticky issue, keyed by a unique label.
#
# Why: the drift detector runs weekly. Without stickiness it opens a NEW
# issue every run while a drift episode stays unresolved, burying the inbox
# in duplicates (we shipped #2/#8/#10 this way). Sticky semantics:
#
#   - An OPEN issue carrying $STICKY_LABEL already exists  -> add a comment
#     (one issue accumulates "still happening" updates).
#   - None open (never created, or we fixed + CLOSED the last one) -> create
#     a fresh one from $BODY_FILE.
#
# So one issue per unresolved episode; closing it after we act resets the
# cycle, and a genuinely new occurrence opens a new issue.
#
# Uses gh (native, no third-party action). Requires GH_TOKEN in the env and
# the repo's issues:write permission. Labels passed in must already exist
# (gh does not auto-create them).
#
# Usage:
#   sticky-issue.sh <repo> <sticky_label> <title> <body_file> <labels> <note>
