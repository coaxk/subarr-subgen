"""#171 Phase 1: does every capability we depend on have a seam on
refactor/drop-stable-ts?

A patch conflicting is uninteresting -- context drift is routine sync work. A
capability whose SEAM is gone cannot be re-ported at any price, and that is the
veto. See docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-04-171-drop-stable-ts-evidence-design.md
in the subarr repo.
